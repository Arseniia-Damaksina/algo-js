## JavaScript Practise

### Lessons Learned

- **Input/Output:**  
  Learned to use `prompt-sync` for user input.

- **Control Structures and Loops:**  
  Practiced using `if/else`, `switch` for decision-making and `while`/`for` loops for repeating tasks.

- **Working with Arrays:**  
  Explored various array operations:

  - Iterating over arrays with `for...of`.
  - Summing elements using loops and the `reduce()` method.
  - Duplicating arrays using loops, the spread operator, and the `slice()` method.
  - Finding minimum and maximum values with `Math.min()` and `Math.max()`.

- **Mathematical Algorithms:**  
  Implemented key algorithms:

  - Calculating the area of a rectangle.
  - Generating random numbers.
  - Computing the Euclidean distance between two points.
  - Recursively calculating factorials.
  - Randomly selecting unique learners using the Fisher-Yates shuffle.

- **Objects and Data Structures:**  
  Learned to organize user input into structured objects and to convert them into JSON format for easy output.

- **Documentation:**  
  Learned how to document the functions with JSDoc comments for clarity and maintainability.
